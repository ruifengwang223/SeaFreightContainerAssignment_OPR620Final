# Sea Freight Container Assignment - OPR620 Final Project #
## Introduction ##
The project applied concepts in Operation Research and Heuristic Algorithms to analyze how to assign items with different weight and volume in various transporting methods. The objective of the project is minimize the transporting cost. This project shows my ability in problem solving by analytical skills.

## Conclusion and Application ##
1. The bigger containers are generally cost-effective if you can fill them up
2. Many uncertain factors may affect the weather, therefore, minimize the fixed cost is necessary.
3. The model can be applied in sea freight of real-world situations.
